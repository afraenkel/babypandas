BabyPandas Documentation
========================

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|

``babypandas`` is a ``pandas`` data-analysis module with a restricted API.

This module is a simplified version of ``pandas`` with only methods deemed necessary for an introductory course. ``babypandas`` methods also only contain the necessary arguments needed for basic table manipulation and visualization, reducing the complication found in ``pandas``. Writing this module as a restricted version of ``pandas`` allows for an easy transition into ``pandas``.
